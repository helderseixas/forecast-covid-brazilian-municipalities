#### Appendices 

- **Appendix S1: COVID-19 Death Rate Forecasts**  
  This appendix contains COVID-19 death rate forecast charts for all municipalities in our dataset. These can be found in the directory: [`appendices/S1_municipal_forecastings`](appendices/S1_municipal_forecastings).

- **Appendix S2: SMAPE Heatmaps**  
  This appendix includes heatmaps illustrating the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) for COVID-19 death forecasts across all municipalities in our dataset, covering all models. These heatmaps are available in the directory: [`appendices/S2_heatmaps_smape`](appendices/S2_heatmaps_smape).
